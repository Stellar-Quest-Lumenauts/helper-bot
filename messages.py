commands = {
    "FAQS": "Please try the fixes and suggestions provided in our <#765222197518139404> channel. Many of the most common issues are already covered there.",
    "ANDROID_CACHE": "If you have an android phone, and you're stuck with a Play button in the lobby building screen, please try clearing the app's cache: Go to Settings -> Apps -> Stellar Quest -> Storage & Cache -> Clear Cache. **Please do not select Clear Storage on this screen.**",
    "SERIES_SUPPORT": "We have broken our support topic into several, series-specific channels. Please ask your question in the <#842774127563374603>, <#842774158089388112>, or <#765215066420805663>, depending on which quest you're having trouble with. This will give everyone a head start in assisting you.",

    "SPOILERS": "**DON'T POST SPOILERS.** We're all learning together, so providing screenshots, descriptions, etc. of the quest at hand before everybody has their chance to begin gives some players an unfair advantage. Don't be that guy.",
    "RESOURCES": "Be sure to carefully look at the resources provided in the quest. There are often some hidden clues and hints within those resources.",
    "TAX": "We are not tax lawyers. Please don’t ask for specific tax advice, and we’ll try our best not to give it. If you do have any questions, please head over to our <#844983942473973760> channel for a list of useful information."
